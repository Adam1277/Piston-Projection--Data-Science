### The Relationship between the Cylinder count and Quarter mile time for auto mobiles.

#### Adam Levere, 100864665

### Introduction:

 * **My question:** To explore and compare the relationships between cylinder count and quarter mile time. Which in itself has many independent variables affecting its dependent counterparts.

 * **Why my question:** The correlation between cylinder count and quarter-mile time is a fascinatingly different perspective in the world of auto engineering. Not only is this information extremely interesting for those in the tuning and performance world, but also shows the correlations related to daily driving and factors important to climate preservation and understanding transportation. Namely because, understanding factors that improve performance, can be good areas for subjectivity when considering how to improve performance and reduce resources to improve areas of life.

 * **My data:** Sourced and collected from an online git repository of 32 cars and their respective features. This includes valuable information, such as name, cylinder count, weight, quarter-mile time, horsepower, forward gears, and more.
 

 * **Why my question with the given data:** ‘Speed’ or more specifically acceleration is something fascinated and loved by most, the idea that I'm comparing cylinder count to quarter-mile time, is something that isn't typically looked at. So for that reason, and the idea that companies now are reducing the number of cylinders in newer cars, piqued my interest in this topic. Especially because we are now moving away from typical combustion engines and I think it's important we talk about them more.
 

 **Names and part functions as background information for the assessment:** MPG refers to the amount of gas that is used by the engine, per mile (Which is changed to litres used per 100kms). CYL refers to the number of cylinders in the engine or the primary source of power (either 4,6 or 8). HP refers to the gross horsepower of the engine at the crank (before it goes to the wheels, which does reduce it). The most important factor in improving quarter-mile time is the power to weight. Which is gross horsepower divided by the weight of the car. With weight being constant, and not easily manipulated, we focus on horsepower. Which includes for the most part cylinder count and displacement.
